A simple app made during Railsgirls Groningen (5-6 June 2015) that uses Ariejan's IMDb RoR API (https://github.com/ariejan/imdb) to fetch a movie's name, director, date of release, synopsis and poster by entering the IMDb URL.

It needs user authentication and a way to save the IMDb posters locally instead of hotlinking them.
